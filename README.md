# giftwrapping

Small web app to illustrate convex hull giftwrapping techniques for point distributions with different types of preprocessing for those points.  Allows for playing around with generation of points, different preprocessing methods and then testing performance of different convex hull gift wrapping techniques.  This is all client side based so large scale points are used, but it can give a better idea of how the basic concepts work.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve | npm run dev

Just a habit of mind to add npm run dev to all of my projects, to indicate I'm working in development mode.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Run your end-to-end tests
```

```

### Lints and fixes files
